        <p>In <i> My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>, we see an entirely new side of Kanye. He has long departed from his humble beginnings and now speaks on life with fame, money, and power. He bares his deepest flaws and issues with an unwavering committment to speaking the truth. Leading up to this album, he had taken an award from Taylor Swift at the VMA's, claiming that Beyonce deserved it. Leading to his public image being tarnished heavily in the media, and the cancel of his tour for 808s & Heartbreak. </p>

        <p>Throughout the album, West's lyrics explore themes of excess, celebrity, grandiosity, self-aggrandizement, self-doubt, romance, escapism, decadence, and sex. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy also openly acknowledges alcohol and drug usage more than West's previous albums. West places an introspective focus on fame, detailing the perks of power that he links to neoliberalism. The rapper addresses deep personal insecurities, although philosopher Julius Bailey writes that he embraced his narcissism in contrast to the chipmunk soul on The College Dropout. West dedicates himself to expressing his emotions, which range from lows to highs of the rapper's mental state.</p>

        <p> For the creation of <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>, Kanye West took an intense and immersive approach by block-booking all three session rooms of a recording studio in Hawaii simultaneously, keeping them reserved 24 hours a day until the album was complete. When he encountered a creative block, Kanye would simply move to another studio room to work on a different track, ensuring the flow of creativity never stalled. The studio was adorned with sheets of paper known as "Kanye Commandments," which included rules like "No Tweeting" and "No Pictures." During this period, Kanye rarely slept a full night, instead taking power naps on a studio chair or couch in 90-minute intervals, often working through the night. His engineers adopted a similar schedule, staying active around the clock to keep up with the relentless pace of the recording process. This relentless dedication contributed to the album's intricate and polished final product.</p>
