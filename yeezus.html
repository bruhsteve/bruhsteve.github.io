        <h2>Unconventional Inspiration</h2>
        <p>West was influenced primarily by minimalist design and architecture during the production of <i>Yeezus</i>, and visited a furniture exhibit in the Louvre five times. A single Le Corbusier lamp was his "greatest inspiration". West worked closely with the architect Oana Stănescu, and took "field trips" to Le Corbusier homes. Fascinated by Stănescu's comments on the unusual and radical nature of Corbusier design choices, West applied the situation to his own life, feeling that "visionaries can be misunderstood by their unenlightened peers".</p>

            <h3>Production</h3>
            <p>"In 2012, West began recording his sixth studio album with collaborators, including No I.D. and DJ Khaled. The first recordings were held in January 2013, in the living room of his personal loft at a Paris hotel, referred to in the album's credits as the "No Name Hotel". West kept compositions simple in order to hear the tracks more clearly; too much bass or complexity would simply overpower the room's poor acoustics. The beats emanating from the loft space, which sometimes lasted through the night, provoked complaints from neighbors. Reports emerged that he and his then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian had moved to the loft in order for West to begin work on the album.</p>

            <h3>Composition</h3>
            <p>According to Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot, Yeezus is a "hostile, abrasive and intentionally off-putting" album that combines "the worlds of" 1980s Chicago acid-house, 2013 Chicago drill music, 1990s industrial music, and the "avant-rap" of Saul Williams, Death Grips, and Odd Future. The Independent, Mass Appeal, and The Village Voice described it as an experimental release, while Meagan Garvey of The Outline described it as West's "industrial album". Rolling Stone described it as "an extravagantly abrasive album full of grinding electro, pummeling minimalist hip-hop, drone-y wooz and industrial gear-grind", while Vulture called it a "punk rap opus", and Rolling Stone called it an "industrial-rap opus". Slant Magazine critic Ted Scheinman described the album as "built on alien, angular beats, slowly morphing drones and sirens, abrupt periods of silence, and a pulse-quickening style of delivery from Yeezy himself", writing that West reconceives the "notion of what kind of music (or noise) can underpin hip-hop".</p>

            <h3>Message</h3>
            <p>In this album, Kanye West delivers a sharp critique of consumerism and capitalism. On tracks like "New Slaves," he boldly claims that people have become slaves to luxury goods and corporate interests, serving as a stark reminder that even at the peak of his fame, West remains deeply aware of the societal issues that surround him. The track is a searing indictment of how materialism can entrap individuals, making them subservient to the very forces they believe grant them freedom.

              "Hold My Liquor" introduces a more vulnerable side of the Yeezus persona, delving into themes of love, heartbreak, and the corrosive impact of fame on personal relationships. This track's introspective nature contrasts with the album's aggressive opening, adding layers to the narrative and showing the duality of Kanye's character.
              
              In "I Am A God," Kanye takes his bravado to unprecedented heights, embodying the persona of an egotistical deity. The track explores the pitfalls of fame and the inner turmoil that arises when one reaches the pinnacle of success. The juxtaposition of vulnerability and arrogance throughout the album paints a vivid picture of the complex, often conflicting emotions that define Kanye's psyche. This intricate blend of social critique, personal introspection, and unfiltered ego makes the album a compelling exploration of Kanye's world.</p>

        <h2>Kanye's 6th studio album </h2>
        <p>Kanye's musical style changes once again on this album. West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin to strip down the sound of Yeezus in favor of a more minimalist approach. The album has been characterized as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of genres, including industrial, acid house, electro, punk, and Chicago drill. West's unconventional use of samples is also present, as on "Blood on the Leaves", which contains a sample from Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of "Strange Fruit".</p>
